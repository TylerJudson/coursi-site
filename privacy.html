        <p class="legal-intro">
            CourseSync ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the CourseSync application.
        </p>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address for authentication via magic link sign-in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect a device identifier (UUID), device name, and platform type to manage your registered devices and enforce subscription device limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>LMS Credentials:</strong> Your Canvas API token and Learning Suite session credentials are stored locally on your device in encrypted secure storage. These credentials are never transmitted to our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Course Data:</strong> Courses, assignments, announcements, grades, and documents synced from your learning management systems are stored locally on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chat Messages:</strong> When you use the AI chat feature with our managed service, your messages are transmitted through our servers to third-party AI providers and are stored on our servers until you delete them.

            <p>
                <strong>API Keys (BYOK):</strong> If you use the Bring Your Own Key tier, your API keys are stored locally on your device in encrypted secure storage and are never sent to our servers. Messages in BYOK mode are sent directly from your device to your chosen AI provider.
